# Timer box
Design and prototyping of a security box that can be programmed by the user to open at after a certain time or at a specified time of the day. The idea is to put inside whichever object you want to keep locked away from yourself (mobile phone, car keys, cigarrettes, chocolate bar, etc.) for some time.
